    abstract={In recent years, work has been done to develop the theory of General Reinforcement
Learning (GRL). However, there are few examples demonstrating the known results regard-
ing generalised discounting. We have added to the GRL simulation platform AIXIjs the
functionality to assign an agent arbitrary discount functions, and an environment which
can be used to determine the effect of discounting on an agent’s policy. Using this, we
investigate how geometric, hyperbolic and power discounting affect an informed agent in a
simple MDP. We experimentally reproduce a number of theoretical results, and discuss some
related subtleties. It was found that the agent’s behaviour followed what is expected the-
oretically, assuming appropriate parameters were chosen for the Monte-Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) planning algorithm.}

      abstract={We address the problem of combining sequence models of
symbolic music with user defined constraints. For typical
models this is non-trivial as only the conditional distribu-
tion of each symbol given the earlier symbols is available,
while the constraints correspond to arbitrary times. Previ-
ously this has been addressed by assuming a discrete time
model of fixed rhythm. We generalise to continuous time and
arbitrary rhythm by introducing a simple, novel, and efficient
particle filter scheme, applicable to general continuous time
point processes. Extensive experimental evaluations demon-
strate that in comparison with a more traditional beam search
baseline, the particle filter exhibits superior statistical proper-
ties and yields more agreeable results in an extensive human
listening test experiment.}

	abstract = {Malware authors often use cryptographic tools such as XOR encryption and block ciphers like AES to obfuscate part of the malware to evade detection. Use of cryptography may give the impression that these obfuscation techniques have some provable guarantees of success. In this paper, we take a closer look at the use of cryptographic tools to obfuscate malware. We first find that most techniques are easy to defeat (in principle), since the decryption algorithm and the key is shipped within the program. In order to clearly define an obfuscation technique’s potential to evade detection we propose a principled definition of malware obfuscation, and then categorize instances of malware obfuscation that use cryptographic tools into those which evade detection and those which are detectable. We find that schemes that are hard to de-obfuscate necessarily rely on a construct based on environmental keying. We also show that cryptographic notions of obfuscation, e.g., indistinghuishability and virtual black box obfuscation, may not guarantee evasion detection under our model. However, they can be used in conjunction with environmental keying to produce hard to de-obfuscate version of programs.},
